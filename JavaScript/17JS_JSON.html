    <!-- What is JSON?

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
JSON is language independent
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand
The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text only. The code for reading and generating JSON data can be written in any programming language. -->

<!-- Stringify converts a JS object into a string and parse converts a string into a valid JSON object -->

    <script>
      let jsonObj = {
        name: "Piyush",
        channel: "CWH",
        friend: "Rohan Das",
        food: "Bhindi", //#bhindiLoverSquad
      };
      console.log(jsonObj);

      //Now if we want to transport these properties using JSON, the question arises, we can do it normally one by one; why there is need for JSON? In some cases, we will have nested objects. Then, in that case, it is difficult to transport each property of the object and convert it into a string to parse them. In such cases, we take the help of JSON.

      //Let us now see, how to stringify the above object. If we write as follows-
      let myJsonStr = JSON.stringify(jsonObj);
      console.log(myJsonStr);
      //now my object have been converted into a string

      //Once, this object is converted into a string, we can apply all the string functions to it. For example, if we want to replace Piyush with Ayush, then we can write as follows-
      myJsonStr = myJsonStr.replace("Harry", "Larry");
      console.log(myJsonStr);

      //   Now to convert this string again into an object, we can write as follows-
      myJsonStr = myJsonStr.replace("Harry", "Larry");
      console.log(myJsonStr);
